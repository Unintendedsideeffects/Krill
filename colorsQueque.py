#How would a color queque be implemented? Average color of the screen and a timecode? Or just an array? Let's start with an array then add the information later
import phue
import main


colorQueque = []

#We imagine that the color queque is directed at the same light or group of lights at the beginning. This should turn into a command queque maybe!
#We need to have the color control already implemented
